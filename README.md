## 🌟 Projects Overview

### 1. 🚗 **Car Parking Simulation**
Efficiently manage parking spaces with this multithreaded car parking simulator. Vehicles arrive, park, and leave, demonstrating synchronized thread management.

**Features:**
- Real-time visualization of parking lot activity.
- Multithreading for simulating concurrent car arrivals and departures.
- Collision-free parking slot allocation with thread synchronization.
- User-friendly interface built using Java Swing.
